          <h2>Sandbox-Like Freedom</h2>
          <p>
            YSFlight provides a very wide range of opportunities and scenarios many other sims don’t get to offer. Hop into your favorite modern fighter jet and wage battle against enemy aircraft using fast maneuvering missiles or use half-ton bombs to take out massive ground facilities while flying Santa's sleigh. Go back into the first era of combat flight and fly vintage aircraft into battle. Step into the cockpit and fly passengers across the Hawaiian Islands for a spring break vacation to Hilo or use the search and rescue helicopter to bring some unlucky spring breakers home after their boat catches fire off the Honolulu coast. Fly the fastest and most heavily armed planes you want in YSFlight. <em><strong>The only limits are your imagination and your add-on collection.</strong></em>
          </p>
          <h3>Some of the possibilities&hellip;</h3>

              <img alt="Planes dogfighting" src="https://assets.ysfhq.com/ysflight.org/aircombat.png">
              <h3>Air Combat</h3>
              <p>Air combat is a big part of YSFlight, both offline and online. You can create your own dogfights, or fly in one of the predesigned missions included with the installation.</p>
            </li>

              <img alt="Pirate ship" src="https://assets.ysfhq.com/ysflight.org/vehicles.png">
              <h3>Vehicles</h3>
              <p>YSFlight is much more than a flight simulator. There is also a wide array of ground vehicles, from military humvees to super cars to ATVs and boats. If you can dream it, you can drive it.</p>

              <h3>Missions</h3>
              <p>With YSFlight, there are many default missions for you to play, these include simple air to ground missions, and the introduction of new ground to air mission you can be one of the turret operators who must defend the airport from attacking air forces, or you can challenge your skills as a commercial pilot, and land in some of the harshest environments known to YSFlight.</p>

              <h3>Weather</h3>
              <p>One of the lesser known features of YSFlight is the various weather customizations it offers. You can change the time from day to night for an added challenge, or set the cloud ceilings to be very low. You can also change the amount of fog to practice flying under hazardous conditions.</p>

West" battles in modern or cold war era aircraft, or show off your skills doing aerobatics for your friends. YSFlight free flight simulation provides the amazing opportunity to host online events such as virtual airshows, squadron competitions, or even races! YSFlight’s extensive online community has been around for nearly a decade, and host all kinds of amazing events. The community is constantly creating addons for everyone, and always giving advice to newcomers.

              <p>One of the most fun aspects of the game is aerobatic flying, where you perform death-defying stunts and pollute the air with airshow smoke. You can perform maneuvers in a formation, or as a single ship demonstration. Keep practicing your skills and get the chance to perform at airshows!</p>

        <h2>A Classic Game Given New Life</h2>
        <img class="wrap-left" alt="YSFlight 10 years ago, to YSFlight today" src="https://assets.ysfhq.com/ysflight.org/10years.png">

          Under continual development by Soji Yamakawa (since 1999), YSFlight free flight simulator provides a growing list of features, with a substantial set of maps and aircraft in the initial download. <strong>The true strength of the game, however, is the modding community.</strong> YSFHQ houses an extensive collection of new maps, aircraft, weapons skins, and tools, while the international community provides thousands of additional mods to try. If you can’t find what you really want, make it yourself! With relatively simple modding tools, almost anyone can produce basic repaints, while greater efforts can produce high quality jet fighters, transformable mechs, or a man on a bicycle.

            <h3>Aircraft and Vehicles</h3>
            <p>There are many aircraft to fly in YSFlight, from fighter jets to biplanes, and from huge airliners to small aerobatic propeller planes. Each aircraft has a unique set of characteristics and is a blast to fly. There are also many ground vehicles in YSFlight, such as racecars, sedans, trucks, and airport vehicles. Not only that, but there are also a selection of military tanks, boats, and even people.</p>

            <h3>Scenery</h3>
            <p>Unlike many flight simulators, YSFlight has thousands of user-customizable maps which provide players with a place to fly over, drive on, targets to attack and runways to land on. Many maps have been modeled on real-world locations such as Hawaii, Arizona, or the UK. There are ground attack maps, civilian airports, airshow locations, and much more. For a lot more maps, check out <a href="https://forum.ysfhq.com/viewforum.php?f=170">YSFHQ's scenery forum</a>.</p>
