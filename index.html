        <h3>YSFlight is a free flight simulator that places the user in control.</h3>
        <p>
          <em>Basic avionics, forgiving flight models, and uncomplicated weapons&nbsp;systems make YSFlight easy to learn, while a vibrant modding and online flight community draws new fans in and holds veterans’ attention.</em>

        <p>
          Shoot down waves of hostile aircraft offline, demolish nearly any ground object with any weapon, or challenge other combat pilots online to test your mettle as a flying ace. Use the navigation instruments to plot a peaceful flight, or hunt your prey with air to ground missiles, coming in for the kill with a hail of gunfire. Fly aerobatic formations, fight in ultra-lights, or land a strategic bomber on a helicopter pad. <em><strong>The only limits are your imagination, your add-on collection, and the rules of the server where you fly.</strong></em>
        </p>
        <p>
          With multiplayer, you can join your friends on servers to do just about anything you can’t always do alone. Join together in teams and dogfight "East v. West" battles in modern or cold war era aircraft, or show off your skills doing aerobatics for your friends. YSFlight free flight simulation provides the amazing opportunity to host online events such as virtual airshows, squadron competitions, or even races! YSFlight’s extensive online community has been around for nearly a decade, and host all kinds of amazing events. The community is constantly creating addons for everyone, and always giving advice to newcomers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Under continual development by Soji Yamakawa, YSFlight free flight simulator provides a growing list of features, with a substantial set of maps and aircraft in the initial download. <strong>The true strength of the game, however, is the modding community.</strong> YSFHQ houses an extensive collection of new maps, aircraft, weapons skins, and tools, while the international community provides thousands of additional mods to try. If you can’t find what you really want, make it yourself! With relatively simple modding tools, almost anyone can produce basic repaints, while greater efforts can produce high quality jet fighters, transformable mechs, or a man on a bicycle.
        </p>

        <!-- a list with screenshots and descriptions of the scenery available -->
        <p>As in many games, scenery is an essential part of YSFlight, and it needs one to provide players with a place to fly over, drive on, targets to attack and runways to land on. There is a wide out-of-the-box selection of maps, 16 in total, ranging from Hawaii, one of the most popular maps in the western YSF community, to more original ones like Slapstick. As with many aspects of YSFlight, maps are highly modificable with a specific program called Scenery Editor. There have been thousands of additional community-made maps released to the public. Some prominent ones are modifications of stock ones, like PMNV's or Griffon's Hawaii, or completely original ones, like York Valley, Saipan, Syria, Canary Islands, just to name a few. The amount of scenery in YSFlight is almost endless, with new maps being created every month. There are ground attack maps, civilian airports, airshow locations, and much more. This page gives a list of available maps that are included by default with YSFlight. For a lot more maps, check out <a href="https://forum.ysfhq.com/viewforum.php?f=170">YSFHQ's scenery forum</a>.</p>
